# security-for-windows-10
These three security apps are recomended for windows 10 though when you search this may not be the order but when I tried it these three toped off all the others.
1. ADWcleaner
2. Malwarebytes
3. Bitedfender
4. Avast

Malwarebytes setup:
Download the installer located in the file section above.
Double click on the installer and when the window pops up click ‘yes’.
Now click what kind of computer you are installing on then click agree and install.
When prompted to get the browser extension click ‘skip this’.
If prompted click ‘finish’.
